Themes allow you to change the look and feel of your Drupal site.
You can use themes contributed by others or create your own to share with the community.
Contributed themes are not part of any official release and may not have optimized code/functionality for your purposes. 
You can also create a sub-theme of an existing theme. A sub-theme inherits a parent theme's resources
